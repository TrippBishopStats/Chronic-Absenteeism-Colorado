* **Truancy**: Truancy is defined as an unexcused absence. The rate is calculated by dividing the reported Total Student Days Unexcused Absences by the Total Student Days Possible.
* **Habitually Truant (Student Count)**: A student is counted as habitually truant if the student has 4 excused absences in one month and/or 10 unexcused absences in one school year.
* **Chronically Absent**: A student absent 10 percent or more of the days enrolled during the school year is chronically absent. All absences are included - unexcused and excused. The rate is the percentage of students enrolled who are chronically absent.
